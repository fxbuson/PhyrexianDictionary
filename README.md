Goal:

To craeate a website where people can look up all known information about the Phyrexian language

Vision:

People would come into this website and see a search bar with the Phyrexian alphabet bellow it. They can either type words using latin characters, or click on the phyrexian symbols to write them on the search bar. On pressing enter they are presented with the dictionary entry of that list, containing the pronunciation and meaning, as well as a list of all the instances where that word is used

Steps:

1.- Make API with all dictionary entries

2.- Host API on a server

3.- Write code to render website from API

4.- Host it on phyrexiandictionary.com (which I already own)
