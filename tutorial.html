    <h3>Reading Flow</h3>
    <p>
        Phyrexian, like many languages in the real world, uses sequences of symbols to represent the pronounciation of words. These symbols are laid out along lines that connect
        them into words, and then the words into sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
        These connecting line can flow in two ways:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Vertically</strong>: symbols read from top to bottom, lines read from left to right
    </p>

        <strong>Horizontally</strong>: symbols read from left to right, lines read from top to bottom
    </p>
